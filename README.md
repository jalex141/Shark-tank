Hypothesis:  Search for correlation in moon and day-night cycles

I found a significat relation in cases and moon cicles
and an astonishing 100% rate of fatal cases during night time


I found out that more cases took place during a full moon 
over 26%
Then I studied those cases occuring at night time and the percentage
rose to over 27Â½ 
I determined some undefined time values using an algorithm 
so I can conclude that using a wider algorithm the percentage
could keep rising as we sort the undefined times
