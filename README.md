# Shark-tank

TO DO's
Decide a hypothesis (or hypotheses) with which you will clean the data
Explore the data and write down what you have found
you can use: df.describe(), df["column"], etc.
Draw at least two graphs that are insightful.
Use at least 5 data cleaning techniques inside a file named clean.ipynb
null values, columns drop, duplicated data, string manipulation, apply fn, categorize, regex, etc.
Show data that validates the conclusions based on your hypoteses in a file named analysis.ipynb
Build a compelling story-telling around your findings. Think of your stakeholders and convince them with your conclusions! (Some slides with few text and pretty plots are normally useful)


Suggested Ways to Get Started
Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean before diving into data cleaning and manipulation methods.
Break the project down into different steps - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
Use the tools in your tool kit - your knowledge of Python, data structures, Pandas, and data wrangling. Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
Commit early, commit often, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
Consult documentation and resources provided to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.


How to deliver the project
Create a new repo with the name data-cleaning-pandas on your github account.
Create a README.md file on repo root with project documentation. Make sure to include as much useful information as possible. Someone that finds the README.md should be able to fully get a gist of the project without browsing your files.
Include a .gitignore
At least 1 jupyter notebook is required
Including your functions in a src.py is very, very highly reccommended (maybe even mandatory, check with your instructors)
